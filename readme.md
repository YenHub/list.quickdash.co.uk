## What is it?

The original QuickList was written around 2013 utilising the then recently released and extremely popular [Bootstrap 3.0] library.

[Here is a live demo] of the original app released in 2014

## Current Development

This project was picked up again in January 2021 during National COVID lockdown as a cabin fever relief project.. üòú

The project is powered by Docker, ReactJS, ExpressJS & MySQL.

The latest build uses ReactJS and Material-UI for the front end.

There is also a pre-configured phpMyAdmin instance to compliment the setup, all running in an isolated environment in the root of the project!

## What does it do?

The idea behind this release was to modernise the project and provide an easy and fast full stack javascript environment, front end, back end and DB included!

No mucking around! üéâ

## TLDR;

1. `git clone git@github.com:YenHub/list.quickdash.co.uk.git`
2. Create your .env config [(how do)](#create-a-env-config)
3. `docker-compose up --build -d && chrome http://localhost/TestAPI`

## Quick Start Usage

### Prerequisites

Top tip... Ensure you have Docker running üòÅ

When running the solution for the first time, you will be required to alter the permissions of the database user.

User information is declared in your `.env` files (see [here](#create-a-env-config)) and consumed by the `docker-compose.yml` where you can override the defaults.

Or alternatively just use root üôÑ

### Create a .env config

Create a file at `./.env` and populate the contents like below, setting a password of your choosing.

Copy this file also to `./server/.env`

_This file is .gitignored_

```.env
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_SERVICE_USER=NodeUser
DB_PASSWORD=NodeUserPassword
DB_DATABASE=nodeDB
DB_HOST=node-mysql
DB_TEST=testDB
```

### Run the solution using Docker üê≥

You can run this solution using Docker, WSL2 and any distro of preference.

See the prerequisites [here](#prerequisites)

#### Start the solution

```bash
# use -d for detached mode
docker-compose up
```

#### Stop the solution (Ctrl+C)
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### What now?

The api is hosted on port 9000, the front end on port 80

This can be customized via env variables, but those are the defaults.

Once you have the solution up and running, simply visit http://localhost/TestAPI to check it's working correctly, and begin developing the API and Front End.

### Where is everything?

#### ./client:
http://localhost

#### ./server
http://localhost:9000

#### phpMyAdmin
http://localhost:8080

## Development Info

### Running FE standalone

The React front end is happy to run standalone from it's root `./client`.

You have two options, the recommended approach is to use Docker, but you can always bail out if needed and simply call npm as you would usually for a React project.

#### Using Docker
```bash
# From the root of the project
docker-compose up client-app
```
Access the front end at http://localhost

#### Using NPM
```bash
# From the root of ./client
# Make sure you have run `npm i`
npm start
```

Access the front end at http://localhost:3000/

**NOTE:** When using `npm` the project runs as it would usually on port 3000

### Running API standalone

Whether using Docker or npm, you can access the API on http://localhost:9000

#### Using Docker
```bash
# From the root of the project
docker-compose up node-sql
```

#### Using NPM
```bash
# From the root of ./api
# Make sure you have run `npm i`
npm run dev
```

### Docker: Commands you can use

```bash
# Ensure you have docker installed & running
# It's recommended to use WSL2 with Ubuntu LTS

# Run the solution
docker-compose up

# Launch docker container (-d: detached)
docker-compose up -d

# Kill the solution
docker-compose down

# Build the containers
docker-compose build

# Recreate the solution & run
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate

# We can then also do (due to docker-compose `container_name: node-mysql`)
docker start node-mysql

# Exec commands in the container (e.g. MySQL):
# docker exec -it [container-name] mysql -uroot -p
docker exec -it node-mysql mysql -uroot -p
```

### Backing up your database

The database is defined in `./docker-compose.yml`

The MySQL instance is volume bound to: `./docker-volumes` and is also in `.gitignore`

## FAQs

### Localhost keeps redirecting to https://

This can be annoying, simply visit chrome://net-internals#hsts and delete "localhost" by entering it into the delete field at the bottom

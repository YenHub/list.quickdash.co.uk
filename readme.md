## Current Development

This project was picked up again in January 2021 during National COVID lockdown as a cabin fever relief project.. üòú

The project is powered by Docker, ReactJS, ExpressJS & MySQL.

The latest build uses ReactJS and Material-UI for the front end.

There is also a pre-configured phpMyAdmin instance to compliment the setup, all running in an isolated environment in the root of the project!

## What does it do?

The idea behind this release was to modernise the project and provide an easy and fast full stack javascript environment, front end, back end and DB included!

No mucking around! üéâ
